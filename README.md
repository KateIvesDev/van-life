## What I Learned

Before this project, I had basic experience using React Router with basic multipage websites. This project allowed me to gain more in-depth experience with some of the cool features of React Router 6 (defer, Suspense, Active Links, Nested Routes). I also skilled up on my experience using Firebase to implement authentication, as well as using it as a database and for data storage.

## Bonus Features

I am adding the following features which were beyond the scope of the course project.

[x] Allow host users to upload add new vans to their profile. This includes allowing the user to upload the van image, which is then stored in Cloud Storage for Firebase.

[x] Allow host users to delete existing vans from their profile. This deletes the van document from Firebase's database.

[In progress] Allow host users to edit existing vans from their profile.

[In progress] Allow renter users to create their own profiles and reserve vans.

[In progress] Allow renters users to leave a rating on vans they have rented.
